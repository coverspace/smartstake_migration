          title: "2.1 Spread betting"
          description: |+
            Settling a bet for "Orlando Magic -5 Spread" involves predicting the outcome of a basketball game with a point spread betting option. In point spread betting, the -5 spread means that the Orlando Magic are favored to win by 5 points. For you to win this bet, the Orlando Magic need to win the game by more than 5 points. Here's how it breaks down:

            If Orlando Magic wins by more than 5 points, you win the bet.
            If Orlando Magic wins by exactly 5 points, the bet is typically considered a push, and you would get your original wager back without any winnings.
            If Orlando Magic wins by fewer than 5 points, ties, or loses the game, you lose the bet.
            Point spread betting is popular because it evens the playing field between two unevenly matched teams, making the betting interest more about the margin of victory rather than the outright winner.

            If the line is -5,5 for Orlando Magic:
            Betting on a -5.5 point spread for the Orlando Magic adjusts the conditions slightly from the straight -5 spread. With a -5.5 spread, the Magic are still favored to win, but now they must win by more than 5.5 points for you to win your bet. Here's what that means:

            If Orlando Magic wins by 6 points or more, you win the bet.
            If Orlando Magic wins by 5 points or fewer, ties, or loses the game, you lose the bet.
            The half-point (.5) in the spread eliminates the possibility of a push, since it's impossible for a team to win by half a point. This ensures that the bet will have a definitive outcome of either a win or a loss.

            Halftime Spread Example: If you see a halftime spread listed as "Orlando Magic -4.5 against the Miami Heat," it means the Orlando Magic are favored to be leading by more than 4.5 points at halftime.
            Winning the Bet: 
            To win this bet, the Orlando Magic must lead by at least 5 points at the end of the first half. If they lead by 5 or more, those who bet on the Magic -4.5 would win their wager.
            Losing the Bet: 
            If the Magic are leading by 4 points or less, the game is tied, or the Heat are ahead at the end of the first half, then a bet on the Magic -4.5 would lose.
            No Push on Halves: Since sportsbooks often use half points in spreads (like the -4.5), it eliminates the possibility of a push because a team can't win by half a point. This ensures there will always be a clear win or lose outcome for the bet.

          title: "2.2 Points Over/Under"
          description: |+
            Points Over/Under betting, also known as totals betting, is a popular wager where you bet on whether the combined score of both teams in a game will be over or under a number set by the bookmaker. This type of bet focuses on the overall scoring outcome of the game rather than who wins or loses.

            Here's how Points Over/Under betting works in basketball:
            The Line: The sportsbook sets a line, which is the total number of points expected to be scored by both teams combined in the game. For example, if the line is set at 210.5 points for a game between the Orlando Magic and the Miami Heat, you can bet on whether the total score will be over or under this number.
            Betting Over: If you bet the over, you're predicting that the total combined score of the game will be 211 points or more. You win the bet if the actual combined score exceeds the line.
            Betting Under: If you bet the under, you're predicting that the total combined score will be 210 points or fewer. You win the bet if the actual combined score is less than the line.
            Outcome: The only thing that matters for this bet is the total points scored. It doesn't matter which team wins or loses, only the total score relative to the over/under line.
            Half Points: Many lines include half points (like 210.5) to avoid ties (pushes), ensuring that every bet has a clear win or lose outcome.

          title: "2.3 Player props"
          description: |+
            Player props, or proposition bets, in the context of betting, are wagers placed on the performance of individual players in a game, rather than the outcome of the game itself. These bets can be on various statistical categories and are a popular way to engage with sports betting because they allow bettors to leverage their knowledge of individual player performances.

            Here are some common types of player prop bets in basketball, along with explanations:
            Points Scored: Betting on the over/under for the number of points a specific player will score in a game. For example, a bet might be placed on whether a player will score more or less than 24.5 points.
            Rebounds: Similar to points scored, this bet is on the over/under for the number of rebounds a player will collect during a game.
            Assists: Betting on the over/under on the number of assists a player will record in a game.
            Three-Pointers Made: A bet on how many three-point shots a player will make during a game, often set as an over/under.
            Double-Doubles/Triple-Doubles: Betting on whether a player will achieve a double-double (double digits in two statistical categories, like points and rebounds) or a triple-double (double digits in three categories) during a game.
            Field Goal Percentage: Wagers can be placed on a player's shooting efficiency, predicting whether their field goal percentage will be above or below a certain threshold.
            First to Score: Some bets focus on which player will score the first points of the game.
            Total Blocks and Steals: Betting on the combined total of a player's blocks and steals.
            Player props offer a unique betting opportunity because they're not directly tied to the game's final outcome. Instead, they're about predicting how well an individual player will perform, which can depend on various factors, including matchups, recent form, injuries, and even playing time.
            When betting on player props, it's crucial to consider:
            Matchup Analysis: How a player matches up against their opponents, including defensive strengths and weaknesses.
            Recent Performance: A player's form in recent games can be a good indicator of how they might perform in an upcoming match.
            Injuries: Not just the player you're betting on, but injuries to teammates that could affect the player's performance (e.g., more playing time or increased scoring responsibilities).
            Game Script: How the game is expected to unfold. For example, if a game is expected to be high-scoring, there might be more opportunities for points, assists, and rebounds.

            Outcome for Whole Match and First Half:
            Betting on the outcome of the entire match or just the first half allows you to predict whether the home team will win, the away team will win, or if the match will end in a draw.
            Total Goals Over/Under:
            This type of bet involves predicting whether the total number of goals scored in the match will be higher or lower than a predetermined number set by the sportsbook. For example, if the Over/Under is set at 2.5 goals and you bet Over, you win if three or more goals are scored in the match.
            Team Totals Over/Under:
            Similar to total goals, but you're betting on the total number of goals scored by a specific team. For instance, if the Over/Under for a team is set at 1.5 goals, and you bet Over, you win if that team scores two or more goals.
            Cards Over/Under:
            This type of bet involves predicting whether the number of yellow or red cards shown during the match will be above or below a certain threshold set by the sportsbook. You might bet Over if you think there will be many cards shown in the match.

            1st Half Totals Over/Under:
            Similar to total goals, but focused solely on the number of goals scored in the first half of the match.
            Player Scores at Least One Goal:
            Betting on whether a specific player will manage to score at least one goal during the match.

Ezek tartalmazhatnak jégkorong, baseball, kosárlabda és foci mérkőzésekre tett fogadásokat. A bankroll menedzsmentet illetően itt is a játékos teljes bankrolljának 1%-val célszerű fogadni. Havi várható hozam 10-20% között átlagolva. Mivel a tippek az összes tippből véletlenszerűen vannak generálva, így a találati arány is változhat az összes csomaggal találati arányához képest.
